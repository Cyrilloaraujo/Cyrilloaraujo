    ; Here you would have the AHK script input the prompt into the appropriate field
    ; This is highly specific to the web page's structure and cannot be generically scripted without more info
    ; You might use something like this to send the prompt (if a text field is focused):
    ; Send, %prompt%
    
    ; If the page and form are always structured the same way, you might be able to use Tab to navigate
    ; For example, to hit Tab three times then enter the prompt, you could use:
    ; Send, {Tab 3}
    ; Send, %prompt%
    
    ; This is a placeholder - actual implementation would depend on the page's specifics
